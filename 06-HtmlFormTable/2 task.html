        <h2>Ingredients </h2>
        <ul>
            <li> 50g melted butter, for brushing</li>
            <li>cocoa powder, for dusting  </li>
            <li>200g good-quality dark chocolate, chopped into small pieces </li>
            <li>200g butter, in small pieces </li>
            <li>200g golden caster sugar </li>
            <li>4 eggs and 4 yolks  </li>
            <li>200g plain flour </li>
            <li>Caramel sauce (see 'Goes well with') and vanilla ice cream or orange sorbet, to serve </li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>
    <ol>
         <li> <b>STEP</b><br>
            First get your moulds ready. Using upward strokes, heavily brush melted butter (use 50g in total) all over the inside of the pudding mould.
            Place the mould in the fridge or freezer. Brush more melted butter over the chilled butter, then add a good spoonful of cocoa powder into the mould.
            Tip the mould so the powder completely coats the butter. 
            Tap any excess cocoa back into the jar, then repeat with the next mould.</li>
        <li> <b>STEP</b> <br>
            Place a bowl over a pan of barely simmering water, 
            then slowly melt 200g good-quality dark chocolate and 200g butter, both chopped into small pieces, together. 
            Remove the bowl from the heat and stir until smooth. Leave to cool for about 10 mins.</li>
            <ol>
                <li> In a separate bowl whisk 4 eggs and 4 egg yolks together with 200g golden caster sugar until thick and pale and the whisk leaves a trail;
                     use an electric whisk if you want. </li>
                <li>Sift 200g plain flour into the eggs, then beat together.</li>
            </ol>
        <li> <b>STEP</b>
            Pour the melted chocolate into the egg mixture in thirds,
            beating well between each addition, until all the chocolate is added and the mixture is completely combined to a loose cake batter.</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Tip the fondant batter into a jug, then evenly divide between the moulds.
                    The fondants can now be frozen for up to a month and cooked from frozen.</li>
                <li>Chill for at least 20 mins or up to the night before. To bake from frozen, simply carry on as stated, adding 5 mins more to the cooking time.</li>
            </ol>
    </ol>
